# Quadratic-Splines

This algorithm calculates the length of quadratic splines numerically using differnet methods of Engineering analysis and computations. it is targeted mostly on solving complex equations when it comes to either differentiation or integration.

This project algoithm is a nice example in dealing with mathematical eqautions numerically with matlab coding and verified simulation.
